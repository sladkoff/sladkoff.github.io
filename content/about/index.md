#### Hi :wave:

My name is Leo. I'm 26 years old and I do software development. I'm based in Munich.



#### What is this site?

This is supposed to become my blog. I'll post random stuff here. The main focus is probably  software related. 

#### Why does this exist?

I don't know honestly. I'm seeing this as an exercise for myself. We often do interesting things 
at work and in private which mostly go unnoticed. Writing them down should help me internalize such things and maybe someone will find it helpful at the same time.
