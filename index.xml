We will first go through some core concepts of Flux and then create our first GitOps workflow.
You will need access to a Kubernetes cluster, a shell interface and a Github account to follow this guide. Note that you can use any git provider (Gitlab, Bitbucket, custom) but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to modify the provided example commands.</description></item><item><title>How I build my resume from Markdown</title><link>https://blog.sldk.de/2021/02/how-i-build-my-resume-from-markdown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sldk.de/2021/02/how-i-build-my-resume-from-markdown/</guid><description>I was recently inspired to update my Software Engineering resume. The problem with that was that up until now my resume was a Word docx document that I would manually export as PDF and distribute. I used to always get frustrated when I had to touch this document because I hate formatting text in Word and/or Google Docs.

This means that I have some source files on my local machine and I run hugo to generate static html/css files. Once I have these static files I needed to decide how to publish them to the internet.
This post is a subjective comparison of possible hosting solutions when working with Hugo.

I&amp;rsquo;m 26 years old and I do software development. I&amp;rsquo;m based in Munich.
What is this site? This is supposed to become my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll post random stuff here. The main focus is probably software related.
Why does this exist? I don&amp;rsquo;t know honestly. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing this as an exercise for myself. We often do interesting things at work and in private which mostly go unnoticed.</description></item></channel></rss>
