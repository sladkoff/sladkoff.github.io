This means that I have some source files on my local machine and I run hugo to generate static html/css files. Once I have these static files I needed to decide how to publish them to the internet.
This post is a subjective comparison of possible hosting solutions when working with Hugo.

I&amp;rsquo;m 25 years old and I do software development. I&amp;rsquo;m based in Munich.
What is this site? This is supposed to become my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll post random stuff here. The main focus is probably software related.
Why does this exist? I don&amp;rsquo;t know honestly. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing this as an exercise for myself. We often do interesting things at work and in private which mostly go unnoticed.</description></item></channel></rss>
